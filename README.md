Somewhere my math went wrong, I think, because some of the percents seem rather small than the numbers given. I could not find where though.
Then, lines 27, with all the different spending's of the passing's, and line 31, with the spending summary, I couldn't get the red boxes to disappear, but that could be because of the math problem.
